This was originally a project for a Web GIS course, that ended up becoming more interesting as time has progressed.
Having rafted this area and wanting to provide a map online that shows such. I undertook to create something similar to what I found 
from Wilderness Aware, sadly it was just a PDF.
This map uses mapbox, the background information on the access points and Arkansas River were created from a student license of ESRI,
and uploaded as tilesets to mapbox.
the info can be found here

I kept it all in the html, as parsing this out was gonna be more time consuming than I intended. But would make things load a little quicker possibly. 

PS - Visit Eddyline Brewing in Buena Vista, CO. Didn't have a chance to add that little detail.
